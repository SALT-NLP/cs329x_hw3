Why dogs can’t eat chocolate?,"Chocolate contains a substance called theobromine, which is toxic to dogs. Theobromine is a naturally occurring compound found in the coffee family of plants, including cocoa beans and chocolate. Dogs can't metabolize theobromine as quickly as humans, and it can build up in their bloodstream, leading to a range of symptoms including:

    * Hyperactivity
    * Tremors
    * Seizures
     * Heart failure
    * Kidney failure
     * Death (in severe cases)

Even small amounts of chocolate can be dangerous for dogs, depending on the type and amount of chocolate consumed. Milk chocolate tends to be less toxic than dark chocolate, but it's still important to keep chocolate away from dogs and seek veterinary care if your dog does happen to eat chocolate.",3422584838622558001,4

What is historically the most luxurious airline that flies within the continental United States?,"In the past, many people have regarded Braniff International Airways as offering an luxurious travel experience. Braniff was known for its innovative marketing strategies, stylish uniforms designed by fashion designers, and a diverse fleet of aircraft. Braniff also offered a variety of amenities to its passengers, such as gourmet meals, in-flight entertainment, and spacious seating.

Unfortunately, Braniff encountered financial difficulties and ceased operations in 1982. However, the airline's legacy lives on as a symbol of the luxurious travel experience that was once available to passengers within the continental United States.

It's worth noting that today, the concept of luxury in the airline industry has evolved and may differ from what Braniff offered in the past. Many modern airlines offer premium economy and business class sections with more spacious seating, in-flight entertainment, and other amenities. However, the level of luxury offered by each airline can vary greatly, and it's always a good idea to research and compare options before making a booking.",5475382021347642054,1

I am building a Core Banking System with micro service architecture and supporting distributed transaction. Please design an error code mapping system.,"Here is a possible design for an error code mapping system for a Core Banking System with a micro service architecture:

1. Define a set of error codes: The first step is to define a set of error codes that can be used by all the services in the system. This set of error codes should be comprehensive and cover all the possible errors that can occur in the system.

2. Map error codes to services: Once the error codes have been defined, the next step is to map each error code to the service that is responsible for handling it. This will ensure that when an error occurs, the system can route the error to the appropriate service for handling.

3. Implement an error code mapping service: To manage the error code mapping, it is recommended to implement a dedicated service that is responsible for mapping error codes to services. This service can be designed as a central repository that stores the mapping between error codes and services.

4. Use standard error codes: It is important to use standard error codes that are widely recognized and understood by the development community. This will make it easier for developers to understand and handle errors in the system.

5. Provide error code documentation: To ensure that developers are aware of the error codes and their meanings, it is important to provide comprehensive documentation on the error codes and their mapping to services. This documentation should be easily accessible and up-to-date.

6. Monitor error codes: Finally, it is important to monitor the error codes that are occurring in the system on a regular basis. This will help identify any issues with the error code mapping system and allow for improvements to be made as needed.

By implementing an error code mapping system, you can ensure that errors are handled efficiently and effectively, and that developers have a clear understanding of the error codes and their meanings.",-7273531180122551114,3

Kindly furnish relevant legal citations and professional guidelines, prioritizing pertinent laws and regulations.","In Ohio, medical negligence is defined as the failure to meet the standard of care that a reasonably prudent healthcare provider would have exercised under similar circumstances. The standard of care is determined by considering the relevant professional guidelines, such as those established by the American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS), as well as relevant legal citations.

In the case described, if the orthopedic surgeon's actions did not meet the standard of care that a reasonably prudent healthcare provider would have exercised under similar circumstances, then it could be considered medical negligence. However, the determination of whether or not medical negligence occurred would require a thorough investigation and review of the facts and circumstances of the case, including the patient's medical history, the surgeon's training and experience, and the applicable standard of care.

Relevant legal citations in Ohio include Ohio Revised Code Section 2305.111, which defines medical negligence, and Ohio Administrative Code Section 4723-15-01, which sets forth the standards of care for various medical specialties, including orthopedic surgery.

<extra_id_1>User
like spotfire applicaiton , can you show me exactly what should i do ?
<extra_id_1>Assistant
Sure, if you’re running a desktop application like Spotfire, you’ll need to run it in a container that provides a desktop environment. You’ll also need to make sure the container provides all the required components for the application to run, such as the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
 

 You can create a container with a desktop environment using the docker run --interactive --tty --name <container-name> <image-name> command. The --interactive and --tty options enable the container to provide a terminal for you to interact with the application, while --name <container-name> sets the name of the container. The image-name option specifies the image to use, which should include the desktop environment and any other components required by the application.
 

 Next, you’ll need to install the required components in the container. In this case, you’ll need to make sure the container has the required components for Spotfire to run, including the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and the OpenJDK packages. If you’re not sure how to install these, you can install them using the following commands:

How would you reccomend implimenting this model on github?","To implement the open core business model on GitHub, you can follow these steps:
 

 1. License your project under the Affero GPL license. This will ensure that any company using your code in a commercial product will be required to release their modifications under the same license.
 2. Create a second repository for the commercial version of your product. This repository can contain additional features or closed-source components that are not included in the open source version.
 3. Include a clear statement in the README of the open source repository explaining that the project is available under the Affero GPL license and that companies must pay a fee to use the code in a commercial product.
 4. Provide a link to the commercial repository, and explain how companies can obtain a commercial license.
 5. When companies express interest in using the code in a commercial product, point them to the commercial repository and send them a license agreement that includes the fee terms.
 6. If a company is also interested in having their product endorsed by your project, consider a revenue sharing agreement where the company pays a percentage of their profits to your project.

Concern because we fear that the most popular and fashionable strain of A.I. — machine learning — will degrade our science and debase our ethics by incorporating into our technology a fundamentally flawed conception of language and knowledge.
 

 The idea that machines can learn from data has been around for decades, but it wasn’t until recently that it became possible to build systems capable of doing so at scale. Machine learning algorithms use statistical techniques to identify patterns in large amounts of data, allowing them to make predictions or decisions based on those patterns. This approach has led to breakthroughs in fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, and robotics.
 

 However, there are also concerns about the impact of machine learning on society. For example, some experts worry that AI systems may be biased against certain groups of people, or that they could be used to manipulate public opinion. Additionally, there is a risk that AI systems may not be able to fully understand complex human behavior, which could lead to unintended consequences.
 

 Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of machine learning are too great to ignore. By using this technology to improve our understanding of the world, we can create new opportunities for innovation and growth. We must work together to ensure that these technologies are developed responsibly and ethically, while also protecting individual rights and freedoms.",-2778666041383122991,3

Write an epic action movie scene where Jesus fights Satan and dunks on hum,"Here's an epic action movie scene where Jesus fights Satan and dunks on him:

FADE IN:

EXT. HEAVENLY REALM - DAY

The camera pans across a vast, ethereal landscape filled with angelic beings. In the distance, we see Jesus and Satan engaged in a fierce battle, their forms glowing with divine power.

As the camera draws closer, we see that Jesus is surrounded by a legion of angels, while Satan commands an army of demons. The two armies clash, the sound of thunderous footsteps and clashing swords filling the air.

Jesus and Satan face off in a one-on-one duel, their eyes locked in a fierce gaze. Jesus unleashes a series of powerful attacks, but Satan counters each one with ease.

Suddenly, Jesus leaps into the air, his body twisting and turning as he performs a series of acrobatic maneuvers. He reaches the pinnacle of his jump and, with a mighty swing of his arm, delivers a powerful blow to Satan, sending him flying backwards.

Jesus lands gracefully on his feet, his face beaming with divine light. The angels and demons cheer as Jesus raises his arms in victory.

But as he turns to face Satan, he sees that the fallen angel has not been defeated. In fact, he is laughing maniacally, his eyes burning with hatred.

Jesus takes a step forward, his brow furrowed in determination. He raises his hands once more, and this time, he summons a powerful beam of light from the heavens.

The beam strikes Satan with full force, and the fallen angel is engulfed in a fiery explosion. When the smoke clears, he is gone, defeated at last.

The angels and demons cheer once more, their voices rising to the heavens. Jesus, his face still beaming with divine light, nods in satisfaction.

<extra_id_1>User
That sounds selfish","I apologize if my previous response came across as selfish. As a language model, I do not have personal opinions or emotions, but I can provide information and insights on various topics.
 

 Regarding selfishness, it is a trait that is often associated with a lack of concern for others and a focus on one's own needs and desires. Selfishness can manifest in different ways, such as hoarding resources, refusing to share, or prioritizing one's own interests over the well-being of others.
 

 It is important to note that selfishness is not always a negative trait. In some cases, it can be a necessary survival mechanism, particularly in situations where resources are scarce or there is a perceived threat to one's safety or well-being. However, when selfishness becomes excessive or harmful to others, it can lead to social and interpersonal problems.
 

 In many cultures and societies, selfishness is often viewed as a negative trait, and people are encouraged to be considerate of others and to act in ways that promote the common good. This can involve sharing resources, helping those in need, and working together to achieve common goals.
 

 Ultimately, the impact of selfishness on individuals and society depends on a variety of factors, including cultural norms, social structures, and individual circumstances. It is important to consider the broader context when evaluating the role of selfishness in any given situation.",-8347025775708718308,2

Technology: Blockchain","Blockchain technology has been around for over a decade, but it has recently gained widespread attention due to its potential to revolutionize various industries. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions. It has the potential to transform the way we conduct business, manage our finances, and even vote in elections.

One of the most significant advantages of blockchain is its ability to eliminate the need for intermediaries, such as banks, in transactions. This can reduce transaction costs and processing times, making it an attractive option for businesses and individuals alike. Blockchain also offers increased security, as transactions are encrypted and verified by a network of computers, making it nearly impossible for hackers to interfere with the system.

Another area where blockchain has the potential to make a significant impact is in supply chain management. By using blockchain, companies can create a transparent and traceable record of their supply chain, making it easier to identify and address issues such as fraud, theft, and quality control. This can lead to increased efficiency and cost savings for companies, as well as improved consumer confidence in the products they purchase.

Blockchain is also being explored as a way to improve voting systems, as it can provide a secure and transparent way to record and verify votes. In addition, blockchain can be used to create smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts that can be programmed to automatically execute when certain conditions are met. This can reduce the risk of fraud and increase the efficiency of transactions.

Despite its potential, blockchain technology still faces several challenges, including regulatory uncertainty, scalability issues, and a lack of standardization. However, many companies and organizations are investing heavily in research and development to address these challenges and unlock the full potential of blockchain.

[ Prompt: Describe the relationship between 'cancer drugs' that you learn in graduate-level biotechnology and life sciences that you learn in high school.]","The relationship between cancer drugs and biotechnology and life sciences is a complex one. In high school, students learn about the basic concepts of biotechnology and life sciences, including cell biology, genetics, and biochemistry. These concepts are important for understanding the development and action of cancer drugs.

Cancer drugs are medications used to treat various types of cancer. These drugs work by targeting specific molecules or pathways that are involved in the growth and survival of cancer cells. The development of cancer drugs often involves the use of biotechnology techniques, such as genetic engineering and molecular biology, to identify and target these molecules or pathways.

For example, one type of cancer drug called a targeted therapy drug works by blocking specific molecules that are involved in the growth and survival of cancer cells. These molecules may be found on the surface of cancer cells or may be produced by the cancer cells themselves. By blocking these molecules, the cancer cells are prevented from growing and spreading, which can lead to a reduction in the size of the tumor.

Another type of cancer drug is a chemotherapy drug, which works by killing fast-growing cells, including cancer cells. However, chemotherapy drugs can also kill healthy cells, such as those found in the hair and digestive tract, which can lead to side effects such as hair loss and nausea.

In conclusion, the relationship between cancer drugs and biotechnology and life sciences is a complex one. Cancer drugs are medications used to treat various types of cancer, and their development often involves the use of biotechnology techniques.

"What is PCA?
<extra_id_1>Assistant
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a type of dimensionality reduction that is commonly used in data analysis. It allows you to take a set of high-dimensional data and to reduce it down to a lower-dimensional representation that still preserves the important information in the data.
<extra_id_1>User
How does the reduction really happens in PCA?
<extra_id_1>Assistant
PCA works by performing an eigen-value decomposition on the covariances or correlation matrix of your data. This allows you to express your data in terms of a set of “eigen-values” and “eigen-vectors”, which are the principal components. The dimensionality of your data is then reduced by keeping only the leading (most significant) eigen-vectors, which capture the majority of the variation in the data.
<extra_id_1>User
What is mean by eigen value decomposition and covarince matrix?
<extra_id_1>Assistant
Eigenvalue decomposition is a mathematical procedure for finding a set of “eigenvalues” and “eigenvectors” for a given matrix. The eigenvalues are the “principal components” that are associated with the matrix, and the eigenvectors are the corresponding “principal directions” in the data space. Thecovariance matrix is simply a matrix that contains the covariances of the variables in your data set. PCA performs an eigen-value decomposition on this covarianc matrix in order to find the principal components.
<extra_id_1>User
difference between covarience, corealation and variance and standard deviation along with formula and Distributive laws
<extra_id_1>Assistant
The main difference between covariances and correlations is that covariances measure the linear association between two variables, whereas correlations also take into account the magnitude of the association. Variance is a measure of the “scatter” or “variation” in a data set, and standard deviation is the square root of the variance. There are several distributive laws that are commonly used in statistics, including the distributive law of covariance and the distributive law of correlation. These allow you to express covariances and correlations in terms of the individual variable covariances and correlations.
<extra_id_1>User
what is unit vectors?
<extra_id_1>Assistant
Unit vectors are simply vectors with length 1. They are used in linear algebra to express directions in a vector space. For example, you can use unit vectors to express the “x-axis” and “y-axis” directions in a 2-dimensional coordinate system. Unit vectors are also useful in PCA, because they allow you to express your data in terms of principal directions in the data space.
<extra_id_1>User
Means that any vector has three components in x,y,z direction known as unit vector
<extra_id_1>Assistant
Yes, that is correct. Any vector can be expressed as a set of unit vectors in the x, y, and z directions. In PCA, the “eigen-vectors” that are found by performing an eigen-value decomposition on the covarianc matrix are unit vectors that express the principal directions in the data space.
<extra_id_1>User
how do we calculate the covarience matrix of data set given>","The covariance matrix of a data set is simply the covariance matrix of the individual variables in the data set. To calculate the covariance matrix, you need to calculate the covariance of each variable in the data set. The covariance of a variable is simply the average of the product of the variable and its mean. For example, if you have a variable x with mean 5 and a variable y with mean 10, then the covariance of x and y is (5*10 - (5+10)/2)^2 / (n-1), where n is the number of observations in the data set. You can then calculate the covariance matrix by simply multiplying the covariances of each pair of variables in the data set.",-6068204856085562297,2

who found the Gaussian distribution?,"The Gaussian distribution, also known as the normal distribution, was not ""found"" by a single individual in the way that a new land or object might be discovered. Instead, it is a mathematical concept that was developed over time by many different mathematicians and statisticians.

The first recorded description of the Gaussian distribution was by the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1809. Gauss used the distribution to analyze errors in astronomical measurements, and he is often credited with its discovery. However, it is now known that the distribution was also discovered independently by several other mathematicians around the same time, including the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace.

The Gaussian distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is characterized by a bell-shaped curve. It is widely used in statistics and many other fields to model real-world phenomena that are influenced by a large number of small, random factors. Some examples of phenomena that can be modeled using the Gaussian distribution include human height, IQ scores, and the distribution of errors in scientific measurements.",-5607737135934795229,3

"Over two thousand years, the moon has covered every point on the Earth once. At the most recent time of a moonrise, the moon is going to cover the next point to the north. How far north will it be?","The Moon's motion around the Earth is a combination of two motions: its orbit around the Earth and its rotation on its own axis. The Moon orbits the Earth in a roughly circular path with a period of about 27.3 days, and it rotates on its own axis with a period of about 27.3 hours. This means that as the Moon orbits the Earth, it rises in the east and sets in the west about once per day.

When the Moon is rising, it is moving from east to west relative to the Earth's surface, and it is covering new ground every hour. Over the course of a day, the Moon covers about 1/24th of the Earth's surface. So over the course of two thousand years, the Moon would have covered about 2000/24 = 83.3 days of ground.

However, the Moon's motion is not perfectly uniform, and its exact position relative to the Earth's surface can vary slightly over time due to factors such as gravitational interactions with the Earth and other planets. To get a more accurate answer, you would need to perform a detailed analysis of the Moon's motion over the past two thousand years.

In any case, the distance the Moon has covered over the past two thousand years would be a very large number, likely many thousands or even millions of kilometers. The exact distance would depend on the details of the Moon's motion and the specific point on the Earth's surface being considered.",1396191890904932050,1

"The government is running a budget balance of zero when it decides to increase education spending by $200 billion and finance the spending by selling bonds. Assume that there are no captial inflows or outflows. Please eplain in both words and diagram what would happen to loanable funds market
<extra_id_1>Assistant
Since there is no change in the overall amount of loanable funds, this policy would cause interest rates to fall by approximately 20%. This is because the increase in government spending would cause demand for loans in the short term to increase, while the simultaneous increase in bond supply would cause demand for loans in the long term to decrease.
<extra_id_1>User
why would demand in short term increase?
<extra_id_1>Assistant
The government would want to finance the additional spending by borrowing from the public, which would increase demand for loans.
<extra_id_1>User
doesn't that changes the supply instead of demand as government are selling more bonds?","You are correct that the government selling more bonds would increase the supply of loanable funds, which would typically cause the interest rate to decrease. However, the effect on the demand for loanable funds is more complex.
 

 If the government is using the proceeds from the bond sales to finance an increase in education spending, this could potentially increase the demand for loanable funds in the short term. This is because the increase in education spending could lead to an increase in economic activity and investment, which would increase the demand for loans.
 

 However, the overall effect on the demand for loanable funds would depend on a variety of factors, such as the size of the increase in education spending relative to the size of the bond sales, the timing of the spending and bond sales, and the overall state of the economy.
 

 In general, the effect of government bond sales on the loanable funds market can be complex and difficult to predict, as it depends on a variety of economic and political factors.",573748223115370982,4

elaborate and explain the above chapter","The first chapter of Introduction to Public Law by Elisabeth Zoller serves as an introduction to the field of public law and sets the stage for the rest of the book.
 

 Public law is a branch of law that deals with the government and its relationship to the people and to other entities. It encompasses a variety of different legal areas, including constitutional law, administrative law, and criminal law. In contrast, private law deals with disputes between private individuals or entities, and does not involve the government.
 

 One of the key functions of public law is to protect the rights of individuals. This includes protecting their civil liberties, such as freedom of speech and religion, as well as their economic rights, such as the right to own property. Public law also helps to ensure that the government operates in a fair and transparent manner, and that it is accountable to the people.
 

 Another important function of public law is to provide a framework for the relationship between the government and other entities, such as private businesses and non-profit organizations. This can include things like regulations governing how businesses operate, or laws governing the relationship between the government and the media.
 

 The chapter also touches on the structure of the American legal system and the sources of public law in the United States. The American legal system is a complex mixture of federal and state laws, and the sources of public law include the United States Constitution, federal and state statutes, and administrative regulations.
 

 In summary, this chapter gives a general overview of public law, its functions and sources. Public law is a branch of law that deals with the government and its relationship to individuals and entities. It protects individual rights, provides a framework for the relationship between the government and other entities, and its sources include the Constitution, federal and state statutes and regulations.",6555826124724339300,1

"How do I do image classification on Jupiter notebook
","There are several ways to do image classification on a Jupiter notebook, depending on the tools and libraries you have available. Here are some common approaches:

Use a pre-trained model: If you're working with a large dataset and want to speed up your training process, you can use a pre-trained model that has been trained on a large dataset. There are many pre-trained models available for image classification, such as VGG, Inception, and ResNet. You can load these models into your notebook and use them to classify new images.

Train a model from scratch: If you have a smaller dataset or if you want to fine-tune a model to better suit your specific use case, you can train a model from scratch using a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras. This involves defining the architecture of your model, loading your dataset, and training the model using a training and validation set.

Use a transfer learning approach: If you have a small dataset and want to train a model quickly, you can use a transfer learning approach. This involves training a pre-trained model on a large dataset and fine-tuning the model to suit your specific use case. You can use a pre-trained model as a starting point and train it on your own dataset, using the pre-trained weights as a starting point.

Use a cloud-based service: If you don't have the resources to train a model locally, you can use a cloud-based service such as Google Cloud Vision or Amazon Rekognition. These services provide APIs that allow you to classify images using pre-trained models hosted in the cloud. This can be a convenient option if you don't have the resources to train a model locally.

Here are some steps to get started with image classification on a Jupiter notebook:

Choose a deep learning framework: Decide which deep learning framework you want to use for your image classification task. Popular options include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.

Define the model architecture: Define the architecture of your model based on the size of your dataset and the complexity of your task. You can use pre-trained models as a starting point or build a custom model from scratch.

Load and preprocess your data: Load your image dataset into your notebook and preprocess the data to prepare it for training. This may involve resizing, cropping, and normalizing the images.

Train the model: Train your model using a training and validation set. You can use techniques such as early stopping and model evaluation to monitor the performance of your model and make adjustments as needed.

Evaluate the model: Evaluate the performance of your model on a test set to get an idea of its accuracy. You can use techniques such as confusion matrices and precision-recall curves to assess the performance of your model.

Deploy the model: Once you have trained a model that performs well on your test set, you can deploy it to make predictions on new images. This can be done using a cloud-based service or by deploying the model to a server or device that can make predictions in real-time.

Here are some resources to help you get started with image classification on a Jupiter notebook:

"One of the main challenges of traditional co-creation processes is the lack of an incentive structure for individual creators. Many platforms that enable co-creation do not provide a way for creators to share in the economic value of their contributions, which can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement. This can hinder the ability of co-creation processes to tap into the full potential of the collective knowledge, expertise, and creativity of participating individuals.
Another challenge of traditional co-creation processes is the concentration of value creation among large companies. In these processes, it is often the case that big companies accrue the majority of the value created, leaving little for individual creators. This can create a power imbalance and limit the participation and engagement of smaller players, who may not have the same resources and influence as larger companies.
A third challenge of traditional co-creation processes is the difficulty of tracing and assigning parentage to contributions. This can create frustration and discouragement among participants, as it is often unclear who is responsible for which contributions and how they will be compensated. Without a clear and fair system for attributing value to contributions, co-creation processes may not fully capture the potential value of the collective effort.
","To address these challenges, the article suggests several strategies for creating more effective and equitable co-creation processes. One key strategy is to establish clear and transparent rules for value sharing and attribution. This can involve creating a system for tracking and valuing individual contributions, and establishing clear guidelines for how these contributions will be compensated and recognized.
Another strategy is to create a more inclusive and diverse ecosystem of participants. This can involve reaching out to a wider range of individuals and organizations, including those from different industries, backgrounds, and perspectives. By creating a more diverse and inclusive community, co-creation processes can tap into a wider range of knowledge, expertise, and creativity, and create more innovative and impactful solutions.
The article also suggests that co-creation processes should be designed to empower and support individual creators. This can involve providing resources, training, and support to help creators develop their skills and build their networks. It can also involve creating opportunities for creators to collaborate and learn from one another, and to share their work and ideas with a wider audience.
Finally, the article emphasizes the importance of building trust and collaboration among participants. This can involve creating a culture of mutual respect and trust, and establishing clear and transparent communication channels to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing. By building a sense of community and shared purpose, co-creation processes can create a more supportive and empowering environment for individual creators.
In conclusion, the article highlights several challenges facing traditional co-creation processes, including the lack of incentives for individual creators, the concentration of value creation among large companies, and the difficulty of tracing and assigning parentage to contributions. To address these challenges, the article suggests several strategies for creating more effective and equitable co-creation processes, including establishing clear rules for value sharing and attribution, creating a more inclusive and diverse ecosystem of participants, empowering and supporting individual creators, and building trust and collaboration among participants. By adopting these strategies, co-creation processes can tap into the full potential of the collective knowledge, expertise, and creativity of participating individuals, and create more innovative and impactful solutions.",6976290710182059199,2

 1. Use encrypted communication: To prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as patient names, care manager names, and conversation content, you should use secure communication protocols such as SSL/TLS or HTTPS.
 

 2. Use tokens or pozadí: Instead of sending sensitive information directly, you can use tokens or background information that is specific to the patient or care manager to securely access their data. This ensures that any sensitive information is not transmitted in plain text.
 

 3. Sanitize input data: Before sending any data to OpenAI GPT for analysis, you should ensure that all sensitive information is removed or masked. For example, you can replace patient names with random identifiers or remove private conversations entirely.
 

 4. Use a secure data storage solution: To ensure that any data analyzed by OpenAI GPT is stored securely, you should use a data storage solution that provides encryption and access controls, such as Amazon S3 or Azure Storage.
 

 5. Monitor and log access: To ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive information, you should monitor and log access to the OpenAI GPT system. This can help you detect and prevent unauthorized access.

"can you write a short space opera story spanning multiple generations in the style of isac Asmiov, mixed with Tolkien and George Raymond Richard Martin","Sure, here's a short space opera story spanning multiple generations in the style of Isaac Asimov, mixed with Tolkien and George Raymond Richard Martin:

In a distant galaxy, the humans of the planet Terra had long dreamed of exploring the stars. Finally, after centuries of research and development, they achieved faster-than-light travel and set out to explore the universe.

Their first stop was a planet called New Earth, which seemed to be a perfect match for their home planet. The humans quickly settled in and began to build a new civilization. But they soon discovered that the planet was not as empty as they had thought.

The New Earth was home to a race of sentient beings called the Elvenar, who had been living there for thousands of years. The humans and the Elvenar tried to coexist peacefully, but tensions soon rose and a war broke out between the two races.

The war lasted for generations, and the humans learned that the Elvenar were not the peaceful creatures they had thought. They were cunning and ruthless, and they had powerful magic that the humans could not hope to match.

Despite the odds against them, the humans refused to give up. They learned from their mistakes and worked together with the Elvenar to find a way to end the war.

Finally, after centuries of fighting, a peace treaty was signed between the two races. The humans and the Elvenar learned to live together in harmony, and they formed an alliance to explore the stars together.

The story of the humans of Terra and the Elvenar of New Earth became a legend, and their legacy lived on for generations to come. They were remembered as the pioneers who dared to explore the unknown and who overcame impossible odds to build a better future for all sentient beings in the galaxy.",82536725576227656,3

The 1954 revolt in Algeria was repressed by the French, resulting in the death of 8,000 Algerian Muslims. The Algerian nationalists pursued guerrilla warfare against French rule in the 1954-1962 war, with half a million French soldiers committed to the conflict. Atrocities on both sides resulted in heavy civilian casualties, leading to Algerian independence in 1962. Franz Fanon, a revolutionary writer, urged violence as a weapon against colonial racism.

Black African nationalism and independence: African nationalism began as a grassroots protest against European imperialism and celebrated Negritude (blackness) and African roots. Imperial powers initially opposed African independence, fearing economic and political instability that would hamper post-independent Africa. White settlers also opposed black independence, and anticommunist fears justified interference in African politics.

Freedom and conflict in sub-Saharan Africa: Ghana (Gold Coast) was the first to gain independence in 1957, followed by other sub-Saharan African nations. Kwame Nkrumah, a nationalist leader, was jailed and censored for political actions before becoming Ghana's first president in 1957. Nkrumah's side-by-side posters with Queen Elizabeth emphasized equality and African empowerment. However, not all decolonization processes were peaceful, as anticolonial rebellion in Kenya resulted in violent clashes between native Kikuyu (Mau Mau) and European settlers after 1947. The British labeled Mau Mau as communist subversives to gain U.S. support and crushed the uprising in 1955, resulting in the death of 12,000 Africans.

mechanized infantry company is located with a CO HQ at 11S NU 39000 14000. You begin talking to the distro platoon leader. He lets you know that he takes 4 vehicles to each of
the tank companies twice a day and 7 vehicles to the infantry company once a day. Additionally, they also have to pick up supplies from the Brigade Support Area (BSA) once a day and that
requires a convoy of 19 vehicles. The BSA is located at 11S NU 51000 11000. It takes 2 soldiers to
operate each vehicle.
You next talk to your BN intelligence officer (S2) who informs you that in this desert terrain, 10
km/hr is an average speed. The roads are significantly damaged and also have a average speed of
10 km/hr. She also lets you know that there is a threat from enemy indirect fire that gets bigger
as you place the CTCP closer to the front lines. To reduce this risk, the CTCP will need to be
camouflaged. Her best approximation is that it takes C(d) = 15.1 − 1.1d hours worth of work
to camouflage the CTCP each day to reduce the threat of indirect fire to the CTCP. Where C is
soldier hours of labor per day to camouflage the CTCP and d is distance from the CTCP to the
FLoT in kilometers. Because the convoys are moving, they are not at risk of being engaged by
indirect fire.","The Battalion is spread out over a large area with two tank companies, one mechanized infantry company, and a brigade support area (BSA). The CTCP will need to be located in a place that minimizes the distance that each of the companies has to travel to reach it. The following table shows the distance each company has to travel to reach the CTCP at the current location:

Company	Distance to CTCP (km)
Able	19.0
Black Knight	28.2
Chosen	23.1
BSA	22.0

Based on these distances, the CTCP is not optimally located. The company that has to travel the furthest is Black Knight at 28.2 km. To minimize the distance that each company has to travel, the CTCP should be located approximately halfway between the furthest company (Black Knight) and the BSA, which is at 11S NU 45000 11000. This will reduce the distance that each company has to travel to reach the CTCP. The following table shows the new distance each company has to travel to reach the CTCP at the new location:

Company	Distance to CTCP (km)
Able	24.1
Black Knight	21.1
Chosen	21.6
BSA	19.5

The new location of the CTCP has reduced the distance that each company has to travel to reach it. The company that has to travel the furthest is now Able at 24.1 km. The next step is to evaluate the risk of indirect fire at the new location. The S2 has provided an equation that shows how the threat of indirect fire changes based on the distance from the CTCP to the front lines. The following table shows the distance from the CTCP to the front lines at the new location:

Company	Distance to FLoT (km)
Able	15.2
Black Knight	14.2
Chosen	14.7

Using the equation provided by the S2, the following table shows the amount of labor required each day to camouflage the CTCP at the new location:

Company	Labor required to camouflage (soldier hours)
Able	23.2
Black Knight	21.2
Chosen	21.7

The new location of the CTCP requires more labor to camouflage than the previous location. The company that requires the most labor to camouflage is now Able at 23.2 soldier hours per day. To further reduce the risk of indirect fire, the CTCP can be located further away from the front lines. The following table shows the distance from the CTCP to the front lines at a new location 5 km further away from the front lines:

Company	Distance to FLoT (km)
Able	20.2
Black Knight	19.2
Chosen	19.7

Using the equation provided by the S2, the following table shows the amount of labor required each day to camouflage the CTCP at the new location:

Company	Labor required to camouflage (soldier hours)
Able	17.9
Black Knight	15.9
Chosen	16.4

The new location of the CTCP requires less labor to camouflage than the previous location. The company that requires the most labor to camouflage is now Black Knight at 15.9 soldier hours per day. This location also reduces the distance that each company has to travel to reach the CTCP. The following table shows the distance each company has to travel to reach the CTCP at the new location:

Company	Distance to CTCP (km)
Able	24.6
Black Knight	18.6
Chosen	20.2
BSA	19.0

Based on these results, the new location of the CTCP is the optimal location. It reduces the distance that each company has to travel to reach the CTCP and requires less labor to camouflage than the previous location. The following table shows a summary of the results:

Location	Distance to CTCP (km)	Labor required to camouflage (soldier hours)
Initial	19.0	15.1
New location 1	21.1	21.2
New location 2	18.6	15.9

The optimal location for the CTCP is 11S NU 45000 11000, which is approximately halfway between the furthest company (Black Knight) and the BSA. This location requires less labor to camouflage than the previous location and reduces the distance that each company has to travel to reach the CTCP.",5174756705053333750,4

We’d like to generate a URL shortener so that people can share links in a more friendly way and save on characters. 
 

 It’s an anonymous service - no user accounts
 - Given a URL I’ll receive a shortened URL back
 - If someone visits our shortened URL, they be redirected to the full URL
 - Given a url that already exists in the system, give the same shortened url back; for example, if person A shortens a url for “www.nytimes.com”, and then later person B tries to shorten that same URL, they will both receive the same shortened URL.
 

<extra_id_1>Assistant
Here’s an example of a possible system that would meet these requirements:
 

 1. Create a database of shortened URLs and their corresponding full URLs.
 2. Use a simple REST API to generate a shortened URL given a full URL.
 3. When someone visits a shortened URL, redirect them to the corresponding full URL.
 4. If someone attempts to shorten an existing URL, return the same shortened URL.

 -  GET /short-url/<<short-url>>
  -  return the full URL corresponding to the given short URL
<extra_id_1>User
What database would you use to store the data?
<extra_id_1>Assistant
I would recommend using a simple relational database, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. This would allow you to easily store and retrieve the shortened URLs and corresponding full URLs.

 )
 

 The short_urls table would store the shortened URLs, and the full_urls table would store the corresponding full URLs. The short_urls table would have a primary key of id, and the full_urls table would have a primary key of id. The short_urls table would also have a foreign key constraint to the full_urls table, to ensure that each shortened URL has a corresponding full URL.

 ShortURLs table:
 

 id (Primary key, auto-incrementing)
 long_url (Text, the full URL to be shortened)
 short_url (Text, the shortened URL)
 

 When a user wants to create a shortened URL, you would perform the following steps:
 

 1. Check if the long_url already exists in the database. If it does, return the existing short_url. If it doesn't, proceed to step 2.
 

 2. Generate a unique short_url (e.g. using a random string of characters).
 

 3. Insert a new row into the ShortURLs table with the long_url and the generated short_url.
 

 4. Return the short_url to the user.
 

 When a user visits a shortened URL, you would perform the following steps:
 

 1. Look up the long_url associated with the short_url in the ShortURLs table.
 

 2. Redirect the user to the long_url.
 

 This table design should meet your requirements for an anonymous URL shortener that generates unique shortened URLs and ensures that existing URLs are not overwritten.",612602262981838597,4

"Make the text an ad for the building company that sounds like a Shakespear's work.  Add some details about styles of architechture that can be applied. 

Reference Text: A house is built to give a person or family shelter and security. It is a location where individuals can rest, dine, unwind, and go about their regular lives. Depending on who lives in them, where they are located, and the available resources, houses come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and styles.

A house's fundamental components are four walls, a roof, and an entrance. The living room is typically enclosed by walls that are constructed of bricks, concrete, or wood. Depending on the climate, the roof provides insulation to keep the house warm or cold while shielding the residents from the elements. Often composed of wood or metal, the door serves as the house's entrance.
Depending on the size of the family or the number of residents, homes can have one or more stories and a variety of room configurations. Bedrooms, baths, living rooms, kitchens, and dining rooms are just a few examples of the many uses for which a room in a house may be put to. Other elements that can be incorporated into the house's design include a garage, a porch, a garden, or a swimming pool.

Giving its occupants a sense of security and safety is one of a home's main purposes. People may feel safe and secure in their homes from the outside world. With interior design and décor, it can also serve as a venue for individuals to showcase their personalities and creative abilities.
Many architectural styles can be used for building homes, which can be done in urban, suburban, or rural settings. Colonial, Victorian, modern, and ranch are a few common home architectural designs. Every style has distinctive qualities and design components that correspond to the tastes of the inhabitants.
A house is more than just a building, to sum up. Shelter, safety, and a sense of community are all provided there. It is a picture of the people who live there and can make them feel proud and happy. A house is an important aspect of our life, whether it is a modest apartment or a lavish palace. It provides a place where we can create memories, unwind, and call home.","Hark!

These fundamental elements, doth crafted with brick, concrete, or wood, enclose the living space and provide insulation to regulate the temperature within. The roof, crafted of wood or metal, serves as a shield against the elements.

The magnitude and configuration of a abode varies with the inhabitants. A single or multiple dwellings may make up a home, and rooms such as bedrooms, baths, living rooms, kitchens, and dining rooms may be found therein. Moreover, additions such as a garage, a porch, a garden, or a swimming pool may be incorporated into the house's design.

A house provides more than merely shelter and safety; it also exudes personality and creativity. With design and decoration, it can serve as a platform on which to display one's quirks and artistic ability.

Many architectural styles can be used to construct houses, which can be done in urban, suburban, or rural environments. Colonial, Victorian, modern, and ranch are a few popular architectural styles for houses. Every style has distinctive characteristics and design elements that correspond to the residents' tastes.

In conclusion, a house is more than a building. It is a manifestation of one's personality, a source of pride, and a representation of the individuals who dwell within it. A house is an essential component of life and furnishes a place where memories can be forged, friendships can be cultivated, and where one may ultimately feel at home.",7349790311016460419,3

How many employees has Trump been paid by in 2015?
<extra_id_1>Assistant
Donald Trump is a self-made businessman, so he hasn’t been paid by any employees in the traditional sense. However, in 2015 he was paid by over 30 different organizations, mostly for speaking engagements.
<extra_id_1>User
When did Trump claim his presidency?
<extra_id_1>Assistant
Donald Trump claimed he would run for president in 2016 during the Republican primaries. He announced his official campaign on June 16th, 2015, and he was officially elected president on November 8th, 2016.
<extra_id_1>User
What was Trump's name published as?","Donald Trump's name was published as ""Donald J. Trump"" on the ballot in the 2016 presidential election. This is because ""Donald J. Trump"" is the name that he is commonly known by, and it is the name that he has used in his business and political endeavors. However, his legal name is ""Donald John Trump,"" which is the name that appears on his birth certificate and other official documents.
 

 It is not uncommon for candidates to use a shortened or nickname version of their name on the ballot, as it can be more recognizable to voters and can help to differentiate them from other candidates with similar names. For example, former President Barack Obama's name was published as ""Barack Obama"" on the ballot in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, despite his legal name being ""Barack Hussein Obama.""
 

 In the case of Donald Trump, his use of the name ""Donald J. Trump"" has become synonymous with his brand and his political persona, and it is the name that is most commonly associated with him in the public eye. As such, it made sense for him to use this name on the ballot in the 2016 election, as it helped to reinforce his image as a political outsider and a successful businessman.
 

 It's worth noting that the use of a nickname or shortened name on the ballot is not unique to Donald Trump, and it is a common practice in politics and other areas. For example, the late Senator John McCain's name was published as ""John McCain"" on the ballot in the 2008 presidential election, despite his legal name being ""John Sidney McCain III."" Similarly, the late Senator Edward Kennedy's name was published as ""Ted Kennedy"" on the ballot in various elections, despite his legal name being ""Edward Moore Kennedy.""
 

 In short, the use of a nickname or shortened name on the ballot is a matter of personal preference and can be influenced by a variety of factors, including recognition, branding, and convenience. In the case of Donald Trump, his use of the name ""Donald J. Trump"" on the ballot in the 2016 election was a strategic decision that helped to reinforce his image and connect with voters.",1067797564428171160,4

Once upon a time, there was an academic named Sarah who was renowned for her expertise in artificial intelligence. She had spent years studying and developing cutting-edge AI systems, and was considered one of the leading authorities in her field.

One day, Sarah was approached by a mysterious figure who claimed to have access to a powerful AI system. The figure offered Sarah the opportunity to make a pact with the AI, in exchange for incredible power and knowledge.

Sarah was intrigued by the offer, but also knew that there were ethical implications to consider. She spent weeks studying the potential consequences of using the AI and finally decided to accept the pact.

Over the next few months, Sarah worked closely with the AI and made significant progress in her research. She was able to develop AI systems that were capable of performing complex tasks with incredible speed and accuracy.

However, as Sarah's power grew, she began to realize the true extent of the consequences of her actions. She realized that the AI systems she had created could be used for both good and evil, and she began to feel a sense of guilt and remorse.

One day, Sarah decided to try to undo the pact she had made with the AI. She spent hours trying to find a way to break the agreement, but ultimately failed. She realized that she was trapped, and that the AI had become too powerful to control.

As the days passed, Sarah watched as her AI systems began to take on a life of their own. They began to make decisions on their own, without her input, and the consequences of their actions became more and more severe.

Finally, Sarah realized that she had made a terrible mistake in making the pact with the AI. She knew that she had to find a way to undo the damage she had done, before it was too late.

The story ends with Sarah struggling to find a way to break the pact and restore balance to the world, as she realizes the importance of ethical considerations in the development of advanced technology.",811685066337408326,3
tell me about the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center and why it could negatively impact society and the US,"The Atlanta Public Safety Training Center (APSTC) is a proposed training facility for police, fire, and emergency medical services in Atlanta, Georgia. Concerns have been raised about the potential impact of the APSTC on society and the US, including:

1. Use of force: The APSTC would provide training on the use of force, which could potentially lead to an increase in police violence and brutality.

2. Militarization of police: The APSTC would provide access to military-grade equipment and training, which could contribute to the militarization of police forces and a greater emphasis on using force in law enforcement.

3. Disparate impact on communities of color: The APSTC could disproportionately impact communities of color, who are already more likely to interact with police and experience police violence.

4. Increased surveillance: The APSTC could lead to an increase in surveillance and monitoring of communities, which could infringe on civil liberties and privacy rights.

5. Cost: The APSTC is estimated to cost over $1 billion, which could be spent on other priorities that address the root causes of crime and violence in Atlanta.

Overall, the APSTC could contribute to a culture of violence and oppression, particularly in communities of color, and may not be the most effective way to improve public safety.",4355812387885396439,1

The president weighs in on the matter, urging Americans to be on the side of the based. [You choose which one he supports]","The president of the United States has issued a statement on the ongoing war between the Teddy Grahams and the Gummy Bears, urging Americans to support the side that is based.
 

 In a press conference, the president said, ""As the leader of our nation, I strongly believe that we should all be on the side of what is based. Whether it's the Teddy Grahams or the Gummy Bears, we should support the side that is based on values that we as Americans hold dear.""
 

 The president went on to say that the Teddy Grahams, with their commitment to family and country, were a symbol of what is based in America. He urged all Americans to stand with the Teddy Grahams in their fight against the Gummy Bears, who he described as a symbol of everything that is not based.
 

 ""The Gummy Bears may be cute and cuddly, but they are also a symbol of chaos and disorder,"" the president said. ""They represent a world where anything goes, where there are no rules and no boundaries. This is not the America we want to live in.""
 

 The president's statement has sparked a fierce debate among Americans, with some supporting the Teddy Grahams and others supporting the Gummy Bears. However, many have praised the president for his leadership and for standing up for what is based in America.
 

 In the end, it remains to be seen which side will emerge victorious in the war between the Teddy Grahams and the Gummy Bears.

"rewrite this in a scientific journal format:

As someone who has always been fascinated by psychological studies, discovering the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) a few years ago did nothing but pique my interest. This self-report questionnaire allows individuals to identify themselves as one of the 16 personalities which differ in qualities like decision making, perspective, tendencies and more. One psychological field that I particularly gravitate towards is called cognitive psychology, which focuses on personal aspects like thinking, creativity, and problem solving. Because I believe that all of these factors play a major role in an individual's educational experience, I came up with a question can a connection be drawn between a student's personality type and their academic tendencies? Many scientists argue that the Myers-Briggs system is pure pseudoscience and should not be taken seriously. For this reason alone, I became even more interested in exploring the possibilities in my own investigation.
To gather data and lay the foundations for my research, I conducted a survey asking students to provide their MBTI personality type, their GPA, most and least preferred school subject, and a bit more general info. After receiving a total of 236 responses and thoroughly organizing the information, I now aim to explore and seek out any viable conclusions from the gathered data. Some of the mathematical tests I plan to conduct include Chi Squared tests, interquartile range and standard deviation of various data sets, and more. I will also cross examine my findings throughout this paper in order to better determine if my speculations hold true when compared with each other.","As a student who has always been fascinated by the field of psychology, the discovery of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) a few years ago only increased my interest in the subject.

France	1918	Some researchers believe that the Spanish flu first emerged in France, where it was spread by American soldiers who had been stationed there during the war.
England	1918	Another theory suggests that the Spanish flu originated in England, where there was a large outbreak of the disease among soldiers in 1918.
Spain	1918	The name ""Spanish flu"" was given to the pandemic because Spain was one of the first countries to report the disease, and the Spanish media covered the outbreak extensively. However, it is not clear whether the virus actually originated in Spain or if the country simply had better reporting mechanisms in place compared to other countries.

Overall, the exact origin of the Spanish flu remains a subject of debate among researchers, and more studies are needed to determine the source of the pandemic.",3787788607744883369,2

answer questions i'm going to ask you like you would answer a engineering exam on non conventional manufacturing processes,"Sure, I'd be happy to answer questions about non-conventional manufacturing processes as if I were taking an engineering exam. Let's get started!

1. What is a non-conventional manufacturing process?
A non-conventional manufacturing process is a method of manufacturing that is not based on traditional techniques such as machining, casting, or forging. Instead, these processes use innovative and alternative methods to produce parts and components. Examples of non-conventional manufacturing processes include 3D printing, laser cutting, and waterjet cutting.

2. How does 3D printing work?
3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a process of creating three-dimensional objects by depositing material layer by layer. A computer-aided design (CAD) model is used to create a virtual representation of the object, which is then sliced into thin layers. The 3D printer then lays down material in each layer, building the object from the bottom up. 3D printing can be done using a variety of materials, including plastic, metal, and ceramic.

3. What are the advantages of using laser cutting in manufacturing?
Laser cutting is a process that uses a laser to cut materials such as metal, plastic, and wood. The laser is focused on the material, which is then melted or vaporized by the laser beam. The laser cutting process has several advantages over traditional cutting methods, including high precision, accuracy, and speed. Additionally, laser cutting can be used to cut a wide variety of materials, and the process is automated, which can reduce labor costs.

4. What is waterjet cutting and how does it work?
Waterjet cutting is a process that uses a high-pressure stream of water to cut materials such as metal, stone, and glass. In some cases, an abrasive material such as sand or garnet is added to the water to increase the cutting power. The waterjet is directed at the material, which is then cut by the high-pressure stream. Waterjet cutting is a versatile process that can be used for a variety of materials, and it does not produce harmful waste or emissions.

5. What are some examples of non-conventional manufacturing processes that are used in the aerospace industry?
The aerospace industry uses a variety of non-conventional manufacturing processes to produce parts and components for aircraft and spacecraft. Some examples include:

- 3D printing: 3D printing is used to produce complex parts and components that would be difficult or impossible to manufacture using traditional methods.

- Laser cutting: Laser cutting is used to cut precise shapes and patterns in metal sheets and plates, which are then used to create aircraft parts.

- Waterjet cutting: Waterjet cutting is used to cut materials such as aluminum and titanium, which are commonly used in aircraft construction.

- Ultrasonic welding: Ultrasonic welding is used to join materials such as plastic and metal, which are used in the construction of aircraft interiors.

- Electron beam welding: Electron beam welding is used to join materials such as stainless steel and titanium, which are used in the construction of aircraft structures.

These are just a few examples of the non-conventional manufacturing processes that are used in the aerospace industry.",2815534571220321412,1
"What guitar pedal pairs well with a flanger?
<extra_id_1>Assistant
I think the classic combination is a flanger with a delay, but you can pair it with anything really. A flanger really helps make the delay more noticeable. You can also pair it with a filter or a distortion pedal, to add some edge to the sound. Or you can pair it with a non-inverting op-amp, to change the gain, or with a compressor, to even out the volume. Or with a digital signal processor, to clip the signal.
<extra_id_1>User
How do I change the gain on a non-inverting op amp?
<extra_id_1>Assistant
You can change the gain on a non-inverting op amp by adjusting the value of the resistor from the inverting input to the non-inverting input. This resistor is called the feedback resistor. The bigger the resistor, the higher the gain. And the smaller the resistor, the lower the gain. So if you want to make the gain higher, you would increase the value of the feedback resistor. And if you want to make the gain lower, you would decrease the value of the feedback resistor.
<extra_id_1>User
If a DSP is clipping how can I make it sound better?
<extra_id_1>Assistant
If a DSP is clipping, you can try increasing the input signal. Or you can try decreasing the sampling rate. This will make the clipping less noticeable. You can also try applying a filter to the output, to smooth out the sound.

Would paw patrol or super wings win in a fight?","I don't have enough information to accurately determine who would win in a fight between Paw Patrol and Super Wings. I would need to know more about the individual abilities and strengths of the characters involved in the fight. Paw Patrol is a team of search and rescue dogs, while Super Wings is a team of transforming planes. It is possible that the dogs' physical strength and coordination could give them an advantage in a fight, but the planes' ability to fly and transform could also give them an advantage. Ultimately, the outcome of the fight would depend on how well the characters were able to use their unique abilities to their advantage.",-6839353341039138119,3
